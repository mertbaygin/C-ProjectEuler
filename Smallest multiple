2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int x=2,y;
    while(1)
    {
    for(y=2; y<=20; y++)
    {
        if(x&y!=0)
            break ;
        if(y==20)
            goto c覺k覺s;
    }
    x++;
    }
    c覺k覺s ;
    printf("%d",x);
    return 0;
}
